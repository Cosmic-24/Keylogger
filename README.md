# Keylogger

As a cybersecurity student, I recently built a keylogger in Python to showcase my skills in programming and cybersecurity. This keylogger has the capability to monitor keystrokes and email the keystroke file to a specified email address.

The keylogger works in the background of a computer and records all keystrokes made by the user. These keystrokes are then saved into a file on the computer. The file is encrypted and can only be accessed with a specific password.

Additionally, I have included a feature where the keylogger can email the keystroke file to a specified email address. This feature can be helpful in cases where the user cannot access the computer physically and needs to monitor the keystrokes remotely.

However, I would like to note that this keylogger project is solely for the purpose of showcasing my skills in programming and cybersecurity. I will not be responsible for any misuse of this tool by others. It is important to use this tool only for ethical and legal purposes.
